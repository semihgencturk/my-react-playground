# React Playground

A lightweight web app that lets you explore modern React features through live, side-by-side examples.

[Live demo](https://sg-react-explorer.netlify.app/)

## How It Works

Spin up the app, pick a card, and trigger the interactions. Each demo nudges you to open the browser console, network tab, or profiler so you can see renders, data flows, and effects as they fire.

## Current Features

- **React Hooks Showdowns** – Compare class-based lifecycles with hook-driven state, effects, refs, memoization, and layout effects.
- **State Management Journeys** – Move from local state into prop drilling, reducers, and a shared Zustand store.
- **Dynamic Loading Strategies** – Explore dynamic imports, lazy boundaries, preload hints, prefetch flows, and deferred widgets.
- **Data Fetching Labs** – Inspect React Query fundamentals, hover-to-prefetch dashboards, and static asset warmups.
- **Skeleton UX Patterns** – Watch skeleton screens reserve layout and shimmer while API calls resolve.
- **Working With Forms** – React Hook Form examples wired with Hookform Resolver and Zod validation.
- **Efficient Rendering Playgrounds** – Put concurrency, memoization, conditional mounting, Web Workers, and reconciliation keys to the test in interactive labs.
- **Functions** – Sync-Async, Promise (all, allSettled), cancellation and race, event loop ordering (micro vs macro)

## Upcoming

- **Guided Challenges** – Missions that coach you through debugging and refactoring scenarios.
- **Code Snippet Library** – Next iteration ships inline snippets you can copy into your own projects.
- **Deeper Coverage** – More React Query, performance tooling, and UI patterns on the way.

## Getting Started

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# start the Vite dev server
npm run dev

# run the ESLint suite
npm run lint

# execute tests
npm test
```

The app is built with Vite and React Router. Once the dev server is running, use the navigation to jump between topics and follow the DevTools prompts for extra insight. Contributions and ideas are welcome—open an issue or PR with improvements or new scenarios.
