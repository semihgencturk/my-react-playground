# React Playground

A lightweight web app that lets you explore modern React features through live, side-by-side examples.

## How It Works

Spin up the app, pick a card, and trigger the interactions. Each demo nudges you to open the browser console, network tab, or profiler so you can see renders, data flows, and effects as they fire.

## Current Features

- **Hooks in Action** – Try core hooks and compare them with the legacy patterns they replace.
- **State Management Tours** – Experiment with prop drilling, reducers, and shared stores already in the project.
- **Design Experiments** – Inspect how styling and component structure shift with each approach.
- **DevTools Prompts** – Inline tips show where to watch network requests and console output.

## Upcoming

- **Guided Challenges** – Missions that coach you through debugging and refactoring scenarios.
- **Code Snippet Library** – Next iteration ships inline snippets you can copy into your own projects.
- **Deeper Coverage** – More React Query, performance tooling, and UI patterns on the way.

## Getting Started

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# start the Vite dev server
npm run dev

# run the ESLint suite
npm run lint

# execute tests
npm test
```

The app is built with Vite and React Router. Once the dev server is running, use the navigation to jump between topics and follow the DevTools prompts for extra insight. Contributions and ideas are welcome—open an issue or PR with improvements or new scenarios.
